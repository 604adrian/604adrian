I am not a fan of excessive self-promotion. It makes me feel like I'm selling my soul. So rather than flattering myself by telling you all the reasons why I'm super cool and you should work with me, I'll try to paint a more balanced picture.

### To start, here are some _unflattering_ facts about me:
*  🎾 I have been told that my hand-eye coordination is underdeveloped
*  👀 I do not have very good vision (require glasses to see)
*  🕺 A professional dancer once insinuated that I was extremely bad at dancing
*  🧟 As a consquence of the previous three points, I probably would not survive a zombie apocolypse
*  👶 I'm new to programming, and have not yet worked any computer-related jobs

### Now, here are some flattering facts about me:
*  💻 My personal computer's main OS is Arch Linux which proves I'm not a normie
*  ⚡  I can play *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* on the ukulele
*  💪 I'm pretty good with JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, Canvas API, ReactJS, React Native
*  📈 I've worked on a number of technical projects to demonstrate my competence in these areas (see my GitHub repos)

### Now here are some neutral facts about me:
*   🌍  I'm from Vancouver BC, moving to Winnipeg MB
*   ✉️  You can email me: [adrianzj@protonmail.com](mailto:adrianzj@protonmail.com)
*   💬&nbsp; Or message me on Signal: [sir_woggleth.87](https://signal.me/#eu/w-tn6kPo--_8uQXVfjn3C0d2AUTqPJlXlkAAeBM6rubr3f6PIytDjKKDOK8zAhd3)
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on websites, browser games
